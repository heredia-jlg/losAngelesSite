				<p>Santa Monica is one of the most iconic places to visit in LA. Yes, it's where there is a faris wheel on a pier that you have probably seen on Tumblr. It's a lot different from Venice, by the way. You won't see as many weird things here.</p>
				
				<img src="images/SMPier.jpg" width="1000" height="665" alt="Santa Monica Pier">
				
				
				<p>There are quite a few things you can do there. Including playing arcade games, carnival games, mechanical games, eating, and of course, enjoying its beauty.</p>

				<p>Also, walking through the promenade, which is a few blocks away from the pier. Even if you're not planing on buying stuff, it's pretty entertaining, and you might find the ocational street performer, souvenir stand, place to eat, etc.</p>

				<h2>Things to know</h2>
				
					<ul>
					<li>They close everything at the pier pretty early (7pm.)</li>
					<li>You can still go and enjoy its view, and just walk around. You won't be the only one. Many people take their dates there at night. It's pretty romantic.</li>
					<li>The Promenade also closes pretty early.</li>
					<li>Don't take people's photograpghs without their permission or they'll curse you and your whole family.</li>
					<li>But there are some bars and restaurants that close a bit later. </li>
					<li>They finally finished the metro line that goes from Downtown LA to Downtown Santa Monica.</li>
